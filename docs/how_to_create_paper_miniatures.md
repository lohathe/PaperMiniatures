# How to create paper miniatures

This is just my method to create paper miniatures that looks nice (from my personal taste :P ) and that can be created at home using simple tools and materials (even when in a hurry).

## Tools and materials

 1. a printer. It is necessary to print the images.
    * alternative 1: plan ahead of the gaming session, create a digital file for all the images that needs to be printed, and go to a copy shop.
    * alternative 2: draw yourself the images.
 2. paper. My suggestion is to use light paper (normal office paper is ok). Using thick paper or card stock paper can create a too-thick miniature for the support or it could make too difficult the operation of correctly folding the paper.
 3. scissors. Or anything that can cut through paper and tape (e.g., cutter).
 4. glue. It is necessary to produce a front-and-back miniature. I suggest a stick glue, but it really depends on the type of the paper used for printing: a liquid glue can create a "wet and wrinkled miniature" which will have problem to stand on its own.
    * alternative 1: if you have a very nicely calibrated printer you could try to print front-and-back the images in order to avoid the "fold operation".
 5. transparent tape. The tape is necessary to make the miniature "glossy" and "water resistant".
    * alternative 1: use a laminator...I know they exists but I never used them, so no much suggestions here!
 6. cork stopper and sharp knife. It is necessary to create the base/support for the miniature.
    * alternative 1: use/buy some "plastic card stand", just make sure that the width of the paper miniature is big enough to let it lock inside the stand.


## Recipe

This is the best method that I have found during several years of trial and errors.

 1. print the images on a paper
 1. coarsely cut each image (leave some padding to ease the "glue step")
 1. fold the image in the middle (make sure that both images are perfectly overlapping)
 1. glue together the two halves
 1. leave the glued image under some pressure (e.g., pile of books) for some time (for better gluing process)
 1. cut the image following the silhouette of the image
 1. envelop the image using the transparent tape
 1. make sure to remove all air bubbles from under the tape
 1. cut the excess tape
 1. take a cork stopper and cut it in 3 parts
 1. take 1 of the parts and create a notch in its middle
 1. insert the image inside the notch
 1. your miniature is complete!

Almost every one of the previous steps are "optional", meaning that ignoring them will anyhow produce a paper miniature. Just use the previous recipe as you see fit!
