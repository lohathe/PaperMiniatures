The main goals for these miniatures are:
 - to take few space to store
 - to be easy to assemble
 - to use easy-to-get and low-cost tools and materials

This repo offers:
 * a guide on [how to create paper miniatures](docs/how_to_create_paper_miniatures.md)
 * [images](./images/) for some possible miniatures
 * a program to ease the creation of a sheet full of images that can be used to create paper miniatures
